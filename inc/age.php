      The IMD Band Chart breaks each student down into their socio-economic group (IMD Band is the UK equivalent of income quintiles more commonly used in the US)
	  and determines past performance by socio-economic status. The ten socio-economic groups are arranged on a scale from 0 to 100%, with 100% being the most well-off from
	  a socio-economic standpoint. Students are deemed to have either passed, withdrawn, passed with distinction (honors), or failed each course.

	  Crucial to understanding the positive societal impact that educational research can have, the chart can be used to determine how people of different socio-economic status were
	  impacted by each of their courses. In order to make coursework at the introductory level better prepare students for upper level coursework, teachers can use this tool to
	  determine whether their teaching decisions effected these different groups of people in a different or disproportionate manner. Knowing whether certain subjects, teachers, or
	  classes increase the likelihood of passing for certain students who are at-risk of being unable to do so is among the most important work to be done in education.
